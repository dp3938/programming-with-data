Police arrested seven demonstrators who had been camping in the area and charged them with domestic terrorism. As law enforcement moved through the area, they found a demonstrator in a tent. Police incident reports obtained in March 2023 state officers first commanded the demonstrator to leave the tent they were in, then fired a pepper ball gun into the tent after the demonstrator refused. At that point, police said the demonstrator began shooting out of the tent. An officer was wounded and other officers shot into the tent, killing the demonstrator. Officers at the scene immediately provided medical care to the injured officer, but not to the demonstrator, as they say they entered the tent using a ballistics shield and only after deploying a 'diversionary device.' The wounded officer was later hospitalized. An independent autopsy commissioned by the victim's family later suggested that the slain demonstrator was sitting cross-legged with their hands raised at the time of their death, as their hands showed exit wounds. A DeKalb County autopsy later found that they had 57 gunshot wounds and that their hands had no traces of gunshot residue, but said there are 'too many variables' to draw 'definite conclusions' about whether the demonstrator's hands were raised. Demonstrators have contested the police narrative, stating that it is unclear who fired first or if the demonstrator fired at all, suggesting instead that the officer may have been wounded by his own shot or by gunfire from another officer. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation later said that ballistic analysis shows the trooper was shot by a bullet from a handgun in the demonstrator's possession, which records show they purchased in 2020. Authorities have indicated that bodycam footage of the aftermath of the incident exists, but not the shooting itself. So far, they have declined to release any footage.

The demonstrators included veterans, lawmakers, off-duty police officers, at least one active-duty National Guardsman, members of several militias and far-right groups (Sons of Liberty New Jersey, Groypers, Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, Boogaloo Boys, Three Percenters (III%), Nationalist Social Club-13, Super Happy Fun America, The Patriot Boys of North Texas, B Squad, and Mamalitia), supporters of QAnon, and other groups, including 100 members of Moore County Citizens for Freedom and the organizers, The Silent Majority, the Eighty Percent Coalition, and the Sovereign Citizens Movement. Leading up to the event, President Trump hosted the 'Save America March' in front of the White House, calling for demonstrators to march to the Capitol building and 'fight like hell,' while Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, called for 'trial by combat.' Over 100 Republican lawmakers were planning to object to the certification of the electoral college votes on that day. 1 IED was found on the Capitol grounds. Around 1 pm, hundreds of rioters stormed and occupied the US Capitol Building for 4 hours, disrupting the certification and causing the evacuation of lawmakers from the Congressional chambers. It has been found that the Proud Boys were key instigators in storming the Capitol and that the Oath Keepers had held training sessions for 'urban warfare, riot control, and rescue operations' in advance of the election. Prior to the riot, members of the Proud Boys had communicated over an encrypted channel to conspire to overwhelm police and obstruct Congress. It was later discovered that the rioters intended to kill Vice President Pence and wanted to shoot House Speaker Pelosi. When rioters pressed toward the Capitol, many Capitol Police officers simply retreated, not making any apparent effort to physically block rioters from gaining access to the Capitol building. One officer was even seen taking a picture with a rioter. Rioters outnumbered the Capitol Police, although there had been numerous warnings online about possible unrest. Some rioters scaled the sides of the Capitol building, broke windows, damaged doors and offices, and looted. One group constructed makeshift gallows in front of the Capitol. Rioters were tear-gassed, pepper-sprayed, and hit with pepper balls and smoke bombs by police. About 1100 troops from the National Guard were activated and deployed in the city by Vice President Mike Pence after the Capitol was breached. Some of the rioters inside the Capitol building had socks filled with metal objects and hit officers in the head, causing multiple injuries; others pepper-sprayed and hit officers and FBI agents with metal pipes and chemical irritants including bear-spray. Some rioters carried zip-tie handcuffs with them. Rioters assaulted and threatened at least 6 members of the media and destroyed media equipment outside. One journalist was hit with rubber bullets by rioters; others were briefly detained by police while covering the event. Two rioters and one police officer were killed as a direct result of the riot, while other two rioters succumbed to medical conditions. Of the rioters, Ashli Babbitt was shot by police while trying to climb through a broken door into the Speaker's Lobby, which would have given her access to the House of Representatives chamber. Another rioter, Rosanne Boyland, died due to an amphetamine overdose but the chaos of the events delayed medical attention and contributed to her death. Brian Sicknick, a Capitol Police officer, died after being dragged and beaten by rioters while defending the building. Nearly 140 police officers were injured and more than 1400 people have been arrested, including at least nine veterans and one woman who stole Nancy Pelosi's laptop with intent to sell it to Russian intelligence authorities. 35 Capitol Police officers are under investigation due to their actions during the riots and six officers have been suspended. Members of Congress reconvened around 8pm to certify President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory.
